# PizzaBot---A-Personal-Virtual-Assistant

In todays world, people love eating pizza and going
out with their friends and family to have pizza. However,
what people do not like is waiting in line for placing their
order. The PizzaBot that we have developed will remove
that problem. It is a Slackbot that is developed as per the
requirement and customization. It will take orders from the
people and provide them options like what modification they
want in their pizza like the crust or toppings on the pizza. It
is developed in IBM Watson as a framework and then using
the integration key provided for the application it will be
integrated with Slack. The benefit of this PizzaBot will be
that even when people are at work they can order pizza in their work place. So they wont have to go out or neither they
would have to wait in line for ordering.
